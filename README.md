# Hyprland setup
*I use this on gentoo but it should work on any linux distro afaik.*

To clone this repo, simply: `git clone https://github.com/SeanIT05/Hyprland-setup` into your `.config`

These dotfiles are still **WIP** and I will be updating them regularly. In case you also use Gentoo I recommend looking into my [gentoo-setup](https://github.com/seanit05/gentoo-setup) repo, as it contains various use flags for the programs used in this setup and more. 

Also don't forget to install [*Nerd Font Symbols*](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) which is needed in order to display the fonts properly.
